# Line width settings

I don't like seeing long lines when I read code, so I don't like writing long
lines, either. The Ruby style guide [recommends][ruby-line-length] using an
80-character limit, and I've found this to be an acceptable length, so we set
that here:
[ruby-line-length]: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#80-character-limits


However, for Git commit messages, Tim Pope [recommends][git-line-length] using a
line length of 72 characters, and GitHub's UI also assumes this length as well
when it displays messages for individual commits (I'm not sure where this comes
from, but it's likely they took it from Tim Pope). So we set this as well:

[git-line-length]: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html

``` vim
augroup local
  autocmd FileType gitcommit set textwidth=72
augroup END
```

So we use 72 for commit messages and 80 for Ruby files, and generally that works
great. However for other, more verbose languages, 100 or even 120 characters may
be the standard. For ultimate flexibility, we draw a column at all of these
points (and the color for this is defined in [colors]):

``` vim
set colorcolumn=72,80,100,120
```

Finally, when a line exceeds the set `textwidth` we mark the characters that are
past the limit with the `CharsExceedingLineLength` syntax group. (The color for
this is also defined in [colors].)

/*``` vim*/
/*function! HighlightCharsExceedingLineLength()*/
  /*call matchadd('CharsExceedingLineLength', '\%>' . &textwidth . 'v.\+', -1)*/
/*endfunction*/

/*augroup local*/
  /*autocmd BufNewFile * :call HighlightCharsExceedingLineLength()*/
  /*autocmd BufRead * :call HighlightCharsExceedingLineLength()*/
/*augroup END*/
/*```*/
