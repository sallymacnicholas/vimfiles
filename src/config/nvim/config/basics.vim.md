# Basic settings

This file contains a swath of fundamental settings. We'll start by enabling
syntax highlighting and automatic indentation:

``` vim
syntax on
filetype plugin indent on
```

Next we'll set our "leader" key, which is comma (<kbd>,</kbd>). Later we'll
define some custom mappings, and whenever we use them we will always precede
those mappings with a comma. The comma is a pretty easy key to press, so it
makes sense to me.

``` vim
let mapleader = ","
let maplocalleader = ","
```

Next we'll turn on line numbering and show the current line and column number in
the status bar:

``` vim
set number
set ruler
```

Next we'll set the encoding properly so that we can enter Unicode characters:

``` vim
if &encoding == ""
  set encoding=utf-8
endif
```

By default, [Vim periodically saves changes][recover] you've made to a file that
you haven't explicitly saved. It does so by keeping a "swap file" -- a copy of
the current file, plus your new changes, in the same directory as that file.
While this sounds like a great feature, it's completely useless if you get into
a habit of saving all the time. It's also a bit of a pain, because very commonly
you'll open a file only to get a message informing you that contents of the file
are in conflict with the contents of the swap file. For this reason, it's better
to simply disable swap files:

``` vim
set noswapfile
```

Vim, like the shell, remembers commands you've run in the past. There are five
different categories of commands it remembers, including Ex commands (which are
always preceded by `:`) and search strings. You can adjust how many commands it
remembers, and here we ensure that this number is large so we can effectively go
back as far as we want to:

``` vim
set history=1000
```

Usually when you close a buffer, it's removed from memory, which means that the
next time you open that buffer Vim has to parse it again. This default likely
comes from the days when computers didn't have a whole lot of memory to go
around, but we don't have to worry about that. So it's a slightly better
experience if we keep buffers around all of the time:

``` vim
set hidden
```

When Vim starts, it displays a splash screen. I don't know about you, but when I
open a file, I don't need to be reminded that I'm using Vim or that Bram
Moolenar created it -- I just want to start working.

``` vim
set shortmess+=I
```

Of course, when you use Vim, you're bouncing between Insert and Command mode all
the time, and so you end up pressing Escape a lot. I actually have my Caps Lock
key mapped to Escape, so I don't have to reach for it; a quick pop over with my
pinky and I'm out of insert mode. Oftentimes I anticipate wanting to do
something immediately after pressing Escape. For some reason, however, there is
a slight delay after you do so. This setting disables that so Vim feels more
snappy.

``` vim
set timeoutlen=1000 ttimeoutlen=0
```

Sometimes it's necessary to tell Vim what type of file you're editing so that it
can apply the correct syntax highlighting. These are called "mode lines", and
often you'll place them at the bottom of the file in a comment so as not to draw
attention. For instance, if I wanted to mark a file as Ruby, I could add `# vi:
ft=ruby` at the bottom. This setting enables this feature:

``` vim
set modeline modelines=10
```

In Ruby and other languages, `#` at the beginning of the line (disregarding
whitespace) denotes a comment. For some reason, if you start typing a comment on
an indented line, Vim will completely de-indent your line. This is caused by the
`smartindent` setting, and we just need to turn it off ([source][so-1]).

[so-1]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2063175/vim-insert-mode-comments-go-to-start-of-line

``` vim
set nosmartindent
```

Mode lines let you override Vim settings on a per-file basis. But what if you
want to override settings for an entire project? Then you can keep those
settings in a `.nvimrc` file within that project directory. These settings
enable that ability:

``` vim
set exrc secure
```

The following setting configures the behavior of Backspace in Insert mode (which
is a bit limited, for some reason) so that we can delete anything:

``` vim
set backspace=indent,eol,start
```

Finally, one of the more irritating things in Vim is the fact that as you type
complex commands (e.g. <kbd>c</kbd><kbd>i</kbd><kbd>w</kbd>,
<kbd>v</kbd><kbd>p</kbd>, etc.) there's no way to know what you've typed -- and
therefore no way to know whether you've typed the right thing -- until you've
finished the whole command. This setting places each keystroke in the status bar
so you get the missing feedback:

``` vim
set showcmd
```
