Hai. These are forked from my friend [Elliot Winkler](https://github.com/mcmire/vimfiles)
because he's awesome and I'm lazy. I've modified some things and deleted what I don't need.

## Let's see what's inside

### Handy plugins

I use [VimPlug][vim-plug] to manage my plugins. Here are the ones that I use on
a regular basis, in rough order of importance:

* [NERDTree][vim-nerdtree]
* [Ctrl-P][vim-ctrl-p]
* [Ag][vim-ag]
* [SuperTab][vim-supertab]
* [NERDCommenter][vim-nerdcommenter]
* [endwise][vim-endwise]
* [surround][vim-surround]
* [vim-textobj-rubyblock][vim-textobj-rubyblock]
* [Ale][ale]
* [togglecursor][vim-togglecursor] // I need to figure out if I need this

### Documentation

A while back I found this really neat plugin called [literatevimrc]. It lets you
document your Vim configuration in Markdown alongside the Vim code itself.
If you're curious what all of the settings do, [now you can read for
yourself][documentation]!

## You can use it too

Want to be like me who wants to be like Elliott? Here's how to make that happen.

### Prerequisites

There are a few things you'll need first.

#### Neovim

First of all, I'm using Neovim, not straight Vim. You can install this using
Homebrew:

    brew install neovim/neovim/neovim

I think it's reasonable to assume that whenever you start Vim, you will very
likely be doing so in the context of a project. To that end, and since my goal
is for you to be able to use Vim for All the Things, I would recommend adding a
short alias to your shell:

[dotfiles]: http://github.com/mcmire/dotfiles

    alias v="nvim"

(If you happen to be using my [dotfiles][dotfiles], then you've already got
this.)

Now if you're in a directory, you can boot into Vim -- all ready to edit files
in that directory -- by navigating there and saying:

    v

#### iTerm

I am also using iTerm, not the Terminal app on OS X. While there aren't any
settings per se in this repo that depend on iTerm, I'm going to assume you're
using it here.

Presently, iTerm needs to be configured to work with Neovim. There are three
changes you need to make:

* You'll want to change the color scheme to Solarized Dark/Light. You can
  download the color scheme files [here][solarized]. Look for a directory that
  corresponds to iTerm, then double-click on the color scheme files (dark *and*
  light) to install them.

[solarized]: https://github.com/altercation/solarized

* You'll want to make sure iTerm is using a Powerline-compatible
  font -- that is, a font that's patched to support Powerline characters (such
  as arrows and icons and things). There's a list of fonts you can choose from
  [here][powerline-fonts], or save yourself the trouble and use Fira Code, which
  is superb. Whichever font you download, drop it in `~/Library/Fonts`
  and you can use it right away. **Make sure that the "non-ASCII" font is also
  set to the same Powerline font as the "normal" font, otherwise you'll get
  strange "X" characters in place of the Powerline characters.**

[powerline-fonts]: https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts

* You'll also need to go into Preferences and override the mapping for
  <kbd>Ctrl-H</kbd>. Right now there's a [bug][neovim-bug] in Neovim whereby it
  treats <kbd>Ctrl-H</kbd> as <kbd>Backspace</kbd>. To fix this, you'll need to
  make <kbd>Ctrl-H</kbd> equivalent to `<Escape>[104;5u`. To do this:

  1. Inside of **Preferences**, click on **Keys**.
  2. Press `+` to add a new mapping.
  3. Click inside of **Keyboard Shortcut**, then press <kbd>Ctrl-H</kbd>.
  4. For **Action**, choose "Send Escape Action", and for **Esc+**, type
     `[104;5u`.

#### Ag (aka the Silver Searcher)

[Ag][ag] is used for searching through files. In addition, Ctrl-P is hooked up
to use Ag as its search engine.

[ag]: https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher

You can install Ag by saying:

    brew install ag

If you already have Ag, make sure you're on a recent version. You can upgrade by
saying:

    brew upgrade ag

### Installation

Whew. Still here? Now for the fun stuff.

First, you need to download this repo to your computer somehow. You'll probably
want to come back to these files later, make modifications to them, and push
them up, so I recommend forking this repo. Put it in a convenient place you'll
remember, such as the same place you store code.

If you already installed Vim at some point in the past, then you'll want to make
sure you remove all of those configuration files first. At a minimum, you'll
want to run:

    mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.old
    mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc.old

Next, run the install script. Since you probably forked the repo in the first
step above, you'll want to symlink all of the files in this repo to appropriate
places in your HOME directory. You can do that with:

    script/install --link

If you want to know what this will do first, say:

    script/install --link --dry-run

For further help, say:

    script/install --help

### Post-installation

Almost there! Now you're ready to install plugins. You can do that by opening
Vim (remember, `v`) and running:

    :PlugInstall

After you run this, close Vim and re-open it.

### And you're done!

If you had any problems, please [create an issue][issues]. Enjoy your shiny new
Vim installation! üíé
